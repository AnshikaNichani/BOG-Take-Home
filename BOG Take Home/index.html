            <p>Hi! I am a second year Computational Media major who loves to code and design applications. 
                I am from Johns Creek, Georgia where I first grew a passion for working with non-profits and volunteering. 
            My biggest contribution to social good includes the non-profit I created, The Literacy Inititative, which aims to tutor 
        ESOL students at Title 1 schools. Thank you for your time!  </p>
